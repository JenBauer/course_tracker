# course_tracker

This is a WIP open source project to meet the following objectives:
* Make an app for tracking a variety of course types, including online classes, classes with an institution, and any other types of learning
* Ensure that tracked courses note the following: a course name, a start date, an end date, a current status, and a way to create entries related to that course (saved related notes), and an optional course URL

This project is part of Hacktoberfest 2024.  All are welcome to work on issues and join in!
